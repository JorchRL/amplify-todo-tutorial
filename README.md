# Simple ToDo App with AWSAmplify

## Live App:

https://main.d3l9nsrhlyyztc.amplifyapp.com/

(please note that I may have to take it down if I exceed AWS's free tier)

## How I worked on this

I pieced together an explanation of AWS, serverles and Amplify by following tutorials and reading parts of the book "Serverless Achitectures on AWS" published by Manning, wich I purchased for this project.

Then I wrote a tutorial myself and published it on my blog. I took a lot of care of researching every piece on the Amplify docs. Because I wanted to write something that others find useful.

You can read the blog post here: [How to (and why) go \*serverless\*](https://jorgerl.hashnode.dev/how-to-and-why-go-serverless)

## Why I built it this way

I mainly followed tutorials to build this. So I didn't bother too much on the decision-making for this poject. I focused on learning AWS and Next.js.

## What did I learn?

(1) I learned a lot about serverless and AWS. Before this I knew nothing at all.
(2) I learned the basics of Next.js and the "Jamstack" approach to web architecture
(3) I learned how AWSAmplify works. And how it compares to other solutions like the serverless framework, terraform and AWS CloudDevelopmentKit. I understand how it uses AWS CloudFormation under the hood.

## If I had more time...

(1) I would work a little more on the visuals with TailwindCSS. For this I just used the default Next.js css
(2) I would migrate to AmplifyUI from the older amplify react components and work a little bit more on customizing the authorization
(3) I would implement more features, like notifications, with AWS.
